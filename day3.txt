Events

The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
These can be useful when performing actions after the page is loaded.

<body onload="doSomething()">


Event Propagation:


There are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM: bubbling and capturing.

Event propagation allows for the definition of the element order when an event occurs.

In bubbling, the innermost element's event is handled first and then the outer element's
event is handled. The <p> element's click event is handled first, followed by
the <div> element's click event.

In capturing, the outermost element's event is handled first and then the inner.
The <div> element's click event is handled first, followed by the <p> element's click event.

# addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)

By usinf the useCapture we can specify the propogation type. By default, it's false,
which means, Bubbling will get called.
